# DBSCAN-Clustering-Algorithm-Implementation

Implemented the DBSCAN clustering algorithm without the use of libraries for this portion of your assignment. 

Input data consists of 8580 text records in sparse format. No labels are provided. Goal is to assign each of the instances in the input data to K clusters identified from 1 to K. All objects in the training data set must be assigned to a cluster. Thus, either assign all noise points to cluster K+1 or apply post-processing after DBSCAN and assign noise points to the closest cluster.
